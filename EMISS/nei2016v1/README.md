Citation:  Appropriate NEI2016v1 citations here.  12US1 NEI2016v1 modeling platform received from the NEIC (IWDW website...). 

Youhua Tang Code/scripts to merge and process NEI2016v1 2d/area/noroad, inln point sources, E2C fertilizer
files for NAQFC 5x CONUS domain. Since the 12US1 domain has the same map project as the NAQFC 5x CONUS 
domain, and just slightly bigger. We can simply trim it for the NAQFC 5x. This code/script includes 
selecting sectors based emission according to their weekday/weekend/holiday pattern, and 
changing year/date, and convert chemical mechnism (if required) and merging all in one process.
